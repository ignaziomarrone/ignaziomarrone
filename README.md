### Hi there! I'm Ignazio ðŸ‘‹

I'm a <b>Software Developer</b> in the making.
Ever since my early teenager years, I've been obsessed with Tech. I built my first PC at age 13 and kept upgrading it and my Hardware-related knowledge ever since. <br>
At age <b>21</b> I fell in love with Software, and decided to become a <b>Full-Stack Software Developer</b>. I'm currently a <a href="https://github.com/zero-to-mastery">Zero to Mastery</a> student.
